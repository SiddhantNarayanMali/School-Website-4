                    <p>On 14 TH NOV 2017, students from Grade VII and Grade VI had the opportunity to visit the Mother Teresa's home for Destitute and Rajeshwari Old Age Home located respectively on 14 th November 2017. The children gained a deep insight into some of the bitter and disillusioned realities of life which turned out to be an eye-opener for those who averred on their way back to be always with their parents through thick and thin.Our school believes in giving first hand experiences to the learners and to sensitize the young towards the needy who have been neglected. Students offered utility items which are required by the trusts. Students from all classes donated generously for the cause. Students presented a cultural programme to uplift the spirits of the inmates. It was really a joyous experience for all the students to visit the hospice and interact with its inmates. The most inspiring thing there was that in spite of facing so many hardships, the people here have brave hearts and are still trying to find endless ways to be happy to live. The effort of the helpers is truly commendable and restored our faith in humanity.</p>

                    <p>The role of schools is instrumental in realizing the Prime ministera's vision of Swachh Bharat .The students of Grades V, VI and VII of DPS Miyapur went on a rally to the nearby Bowrampet village on 29/08.17. They carried placards highlighting the importance of a clean and healthier India .That was not all, the rally culminated with a very inspirational song and a street play in the local vernacular. The student's rousing performance did strike a chord with the villagers and they shared their grievances and expectations with the students who conducted a survey on major issues on sanitation and hygiene. The data was compiled, graphically interpreted and analyzed. Learners then shared their findings with their fellow mates and the Environment Friendly Girl and Boy Prefect, Head Boy and Head Girl shared the same with the Gram Panchayat officials. This was indeed a great experiential learning and an eye opener for the learners as they had a brush with the true picture of rural life.</p>
